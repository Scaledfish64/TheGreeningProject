          We believe that converting people to clean energy will be the sole
          determinant of the future for us and our planet, and that it is
          crucial to execute properly. Our mission is to ensure that you change
          your carbon footprint to a sustainable level, in a way that best suits
          your needs.

            The Greening Project’s purpose is to preserve human health and the
            environment we live in. We educate homeowners about ways that they
            can reduce their negative impact on the environment, while also
            benefiting them financially. We provide information about different
            types of green and clean energy-efficient resources and solutions on
            our website that can help you decide what you can do to help the
            environment and profit. We also take your budget into consideration
            and list possible plans to use green energy effectively. This
            website also has statistics that show what impact homeowners could
            have on the environment if they switch to using clean energy
            solutions. If you are searching for green energy for your home, we
            can help!

        Look out for buying appliances with an Energy Star label, they can help
        you save energy every day. Another product label to look out for is
        Watersense, which indicates that what you are buying uses less water
        than is usually expected of that product. Installing solar panels can
        also help. Participating in a community program, which makes you pay
        monthly rather than all at once for your solar panels, can help your
        budget as well. If there is accessible wind energy in your area, you can
        use that as an alternitive to solar panels. If you want to reduce the
        impact of your heating and cooling, make sure to check out geothermal
        heating/cooling devices, which uses much less energy than a traditional
        AC.

          The three main types of clean energy for your house are solar panels,
          wind energy, and geothermal. Here is some information on all three.
          <br />
          Geothermal: Geothermal heat pumps, as the name suggests, uses the
          Earth’s natural temperature to balance the temperature inside of
          homes, in order to heat or cool the area.Geothermal heat pumps can
          reduce energy consumption and emissions up to 44% compared to
          air-source heat pumps and 72% compared to standard air-conditioning
          equipment
          <br />
          Wind: Wind energy can also be one of the most efficient Energy sources
          if available in your area. It provides electricity without burning any
          fuel or polluting the air. Wind energy helps avoid 329 million metric
          tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.
